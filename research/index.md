6. SOFIA: Magnetic fields toward M17 cloud.

Star formation is a complex process, which is affected by self-gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields (B-fields). Understanding the exact role of magnetic fields in the evolution of dense clouds and star  formation processes is a challenge in modern astrophysics. Dust polarization induced by aligned grains is a popular technique to study b-fields. The strength of B-fields can be estimated using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method via thermal dust polarization.

This study reports the measurement of the component of magnetic fields in the plane-of-sky of the M17 region (Figure above) using the thermal dust polarization taken with SOFIA/HAWC+ at 154 μm wavelength. Using the DCF method, we found the presence of strong magnetic fields of the order of 327±34 μG and 839±80 μG in lower- and higher-density regions, respectively. We also calculate the gravitational mass-to-magnetic flux ratio, and address the relative contribution of B-fields and turbulence in M17 region. In addition, we investigate the dust grain alignment in this region using the radiative torque paradigm.
