# Research

My research interests span both observational cosmology on `Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)` Radiation measurement and roles of magnetic fields in star formation. <br>

Most of my work has been working on the simulation of systematic effects of CMB polarization measurement and instrumentation on superconducting `Transition Edge Sensor (TES)` for CMB experiments. <br>

On the other hand, I am also investigating data analysis of magnetic fields in molecular clouds to study the evolution and formation of stars. <br>
		
I has published over 13 scientific journals publications and 8 conference proceeding papers for approval.<br>
