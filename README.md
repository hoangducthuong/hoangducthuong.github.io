# About

I am currently a lecturer/researcher in the Department of Space and Applications (DSA) at University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH) since January 1, 2021. 
I obtained Ph.D in Physics of the Universe from AstroParticle and Cosmology (APC) laboratory, University of Paris, in 2018. 
After completing PhD, I won an appointment as a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. <br>

# Research

My research interests span both observational cosmology on `Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)` Radiation measurement and roles of magnetic fields in star formation. <br>
Most of my work has been working on the simulation of systematic effects of CMB polarization measurement and instrumentation on superconducting `Transition Edge Sensor (TES)` for CMB experiments. <br>
On the other hand, I am also investigating data analysis of magnetic fields in molecular clouds to study the evolution and formation of stars. <br>
		
I has published over 13 scientific journals publications and 8 conference proceeding papers for approval.<br>
