	<h1>Hi there, I am Thuong D. HOANG</h1>
		<p>
I am currently a lecturer/researcher in the Department of Space and Applications (DSA) at University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH) since January 1, 2021. 
I obtained Ph.D in Physics of the Universe from AstroParticle and Cosmology (APC) laboratory, University of Paris, in 2018. 
After completing PhD, I won an appointment as a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. <br>

<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>  
		My research interests span both observational cosmology on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation measurement and roles of magnetic fields in star formation. <br>
		Most of my work has been working on the simulation of systematic effects of CMB polarization measurement and instrumentation on superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) for CMB experiments. <br>
		On the other hand, I am also investigating data analysis of magnetic fields in molecular clouds to study the evolution and formation of stars. <br>
		
		I has published over 13 scientific journals publications and 8 conference proceeding papers for approval.<br>
