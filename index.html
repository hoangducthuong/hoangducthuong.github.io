	<h1>Hi there, I am Thuong D. HOANG</h1>
		<p>
I am currently a lecturer/researcher in the Department of Space and Applications (DSA) at University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH) since January 1, 2021. 
I obtained his PhD in Physics of the Universe from AstroParticle and Cosmology (APC) laboratory, University of Paris, in 2018. 
After completing his PhD, I won an appointment as a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University. <br>

<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>  
		My research interests span both observational cosmology on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation measurement and roles of the magnetic field in star formation. 
		Much of my work has been working on the simulation of systematic effects of CMB polarization measurement and instrumentation on superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) for CMB experiments. 
		On the other hand, he is also investigating data analysis of magnetic fields in molecular clouds to study the evolution and formation of stars. <br>
		
		I has published over 13 scientific journals publications and 8 conference proceeding papers for approval.
